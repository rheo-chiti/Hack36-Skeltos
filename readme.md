## Steps for Installation of apk
- Download the `skeleton.apk` file from  <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/18GS6hB1GBV5m1a_Fgum3khsHgp5wPTjh/view">here</a>
- Download the `ImageTarget` file from  <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LjpsfxS4NBB7xggW8uBBdC7PI4efGNUm/view?usp=sharing">here</a>
- Open the `ImageTarget` file on your laptop or another phone as an image(Zoom it in so that it fills the whole space)
- Install the apk & ignore all the scan warnings. 
- When the apk runs place your phone in such a way that it's camera faces the `ImageTarget`  

On the laptop it will look something like this:-

If by any means skeleton isn't showing on the `ImageTarget` start over.  

Let's move on the next part of the app:-  
- Try to speak this word "Hand", now the screenshot will look something like this:-

Notice the green arrow that came  

- App is built successfully now, try to use any of these commands to run:-  
* `hand`, `leg`, `spinal cord`, `skull`, `ribs`, `wrist`, `pelvis`, `shoulder`, `feet`, `thigh`  
On calling any of these functions corresponding body part will be denoted by the arrow and text will be shown accordingly. Like in the case of `hand` an arrow was pointed to the hand and text was shown.
